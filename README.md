# Spring demo application

## Running Locally

* Start up the Service using the following command

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

* A very basic UI to exercise the API is available at http://localhost:8080

* This repo is primarily for testing out the Jenkins pipeline that uses it, very little else useful.
